# Builder Pattern

- It is a creational design pattern
- It lets you construct complex objects step by step.
- Is useful when you need to create structs with a specific configuration but using the same construction
  code
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product.

### Disadvantages:

- The overall complexity of the code increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
